TODO:

0. We need to come up with some code structure. I wrote some code while doing my best to not commit to any structure. DONE

1. Someone needs to code the AnimationStateBehaviour class that should deal with switching between
different types of animations, e.g. idle, attack1, attack2, death and so on.
All that functionality should be encapsulated in an update() method.     DONE

2. Someone needs to write the collision code (player-map, player-enemy).   DONE

3. Some of the entities should be able to fire projectiles. DONE

4. Someone needs to write a class that handles AI behaviour. This will be used for all enemies.
The simplest thing that they need to be able to do is to run towards the player and once they are close enough,
to start hitting him repeatedly. All that functionality should be encapsulated in an update() method. DONE

5. Need a GameState class that switches between menus and also starts game. DONE

6. Someone has to implement object creation and destruction. DONE

7. Generate tiles with a .txt file. DONE

8. Implement scrolling.

9. Need some nice design and pictures for start menu.

10. We still don't have any sprites at all.

11. We don't have any sounds and music.

12. Need the code for random room- and enemy- generation.

13. Need to figure out how to make the final boss challenging enough.

14. Also tutorials, some score system, leveling, gold, treasure chests and weapons.(it's all in the report)

15. Dodging range/magic attacks. (also in the report)

16. We've got plenty of tasks and not much time. Try to start as soon as you can.
